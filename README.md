# Deep Learning With Python Projects
A collection of Deep Learning projects I'm doing in order to sharpen my skills.

My first deep learning project a classifier for handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset: https://github.com/JayThibs/Deep-Learning-With-Python-Projects/blob/master/Deep-Learning-Introduction.ipynb

We can see the that the model can accurately predict (96.32 % accuracy) which number is handwritten on an image:
