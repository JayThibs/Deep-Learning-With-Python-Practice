    "What it Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that:\n",
    "\n",
    "• use a cascade of many layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. The algorithms may be supervised or unsupervised and applications include pattern analysis (unsupervised) and classification (supervised).\n",
    "\n",
    "• are based on the (unsupervised) learning of multiple levels of features or representations of data. Higher level features are derived from lower level features to form a hierarchical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "• are part of the broader machine learning field of learning representations of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple oversimplification: Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple hidden layers that can learn increasingly abstract representations of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, deep learning has led to major advances in computer vision. We're now able to classify images, find objects in them, and even label them with captions. To do so, deep neural networks with many hidden layers can sequentially learn more complex features from the raw input image:\n",
    "\n",
    "• The first hidden layers might only learn local edge patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Then, each subsequent layer (or filter) learns more complex representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Finally, the last layer can classify the image as a cat or kangaroo.\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of deep neural networks are called Convolutional Neural Networks. This notebook will look at convolutional Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) are multi-layer neural networks (sometimes up to 20 or more layers) that assume the input data to be images.\n",
    "\n",
    "By making this requirement, CNN's can drastically reduce the number of parameters that need to be tuned. Therefore, CNN's can efficiently handle the high dimensionality of raw images."
